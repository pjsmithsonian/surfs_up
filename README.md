## Overview
To determine the viability of the surf and ice cream shop in Oahu we are analyzing the temperature data from June and December.

## Results
In our analysis we found the following 3 main takeaways:

 - With a mean temperature in the 70s for both June and December, the weather is conducive to having this business year round.
 - Both months do not have much variance of temperature having only a standard deviation of 3.25 for June and 3.74 for December. The temperature is not only good, but consistent.
 - The minimum temperature recorded for December is 56 degrees, so there may not be as much of a demand at times in December as June, but since the mean and standard deviation are consistent, the business should still perform well most years in December.

## Summary
With the analysis from above, we should be confident to open this surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. Consistent temperatures should keep business up during most parts of the year. Additional analysis should be performed as well relating to the rain for these times of years. Temperatures analysis from other months, such as February or March would also be beneficial to be sure that other months that may be cooler are also evaluated.
